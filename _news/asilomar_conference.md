The <a href="https://www.asilomarsscconf.org/">Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</a> took place October 26–29, 2025. I presented our paper, “Tensor-Based Compressive Measurements in Two-Dimensional Massive MIMO Systems,” and enjoyed sharing our results and answering audience questions. It was a great event and an excellent opportunity to meet renowned signal-processing researchers, exchange ideas, and get valuable feedback.
